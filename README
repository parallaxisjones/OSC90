This is the ardour 5 project file for the Penguinators submission for the One Synth Challenge #90, composed of ssj71 and rghvdberg.

It was done using git by one of us working on it while the other slept or worked. We found changes aren't mergable so only one person at a time should work on it. It went very well though for us, with a large timezone difference. 
Feel free to open it up and see what we did, use the Helm patches we used and/or remix it!
